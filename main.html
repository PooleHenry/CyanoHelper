<h2>CyanoHelper</h2>

<p>This site can help you improve the tonal fidelity of your cyanotypes by customizing your negative.</p>

<p><img alt="Original image of monkey" src="/images/monkey_original.jpg" /> <img alt="Low fidelity cyanotype of monkey" src="/images/monkey_low.jpg" /> <img alt="High fidelity cyanotype of monkey" src="/images/monkey_good.jpg" /></p>

<p>In your cyanotypes, you might notice areas with blown highlights and crushed shadows (limiting the detail you can see in your print). If you try fixing one of these issues by increasing or decreasing exposure time, it can make the other worse. Even in midtone areas, you might notice that things like gradients don't look quite right.</p>

<h4>Why does this happen, and how do we fix it?</h4>

<p>The two big issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Nonlinear response to light</li>
	<li>Limited dynamic range ("high contrast")</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1: Print a test negative</h4>

<h4>Step 2: Upload the test cyanotype</h4>

<h4>Step 3: Make customized negatives!</h4>
